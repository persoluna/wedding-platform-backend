# Wedding Platform Backend

A Laravel 12 + Filament 4 backend that powers a curated wedding marketplace. The system lets administrators, agencies, and vendors collaborate on inquiries, bookings, and marketing assets while exposing a clean read-only API for the public website.

---

## 1. Mission & Scope

| Goal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Centralize supply | Capture all agencies, vendors, services, and media in one authoritative database with soft-delete safety rails. |
| Empower operations | Provide Filament panels tailored for admins, agencies, and vendors, so each role can act on inquiries, availability, and promotions. |
| Feed the frontend | Deliver fast, filterable JSON endpoints for agencies and vendors so the marketing site can showcase live data. |

---

## 2. Architecture Snapshot

| Layer | Implementation | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | Laravel 12 (PHP 8.3) | Modern routing, queues, Eloquent ORM, first-class Sail support. |
| Admin UI | Filament 4 multi-panel (`/admin`, `/agency`, `/vendor`) with Filament Shield | Accelerates CRUD, enforces role-aware permissions, gives widgets/dashboards out of the box. |
| Domain layer | `app/Domain/*` namespaces plus Eloquent models in `app/Models` | Keeps business logic close to domain language while still leveraging Eloquent relations. |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Sail | Reliable relational storage with JSON support for flexible attributes. |
| Media | Spatie Laravel Media Library (`media` table) | Unified handling for logos, banners, galleries; enforces single-file/logo collections. |
| APIs | Versioned read-only endpoints under `routes/api.php` (currently `v1`) | Decouples public site needs from Filament; makes it easy to evolve versions later. |
| Auth | Panel auth today; Sanctum-ready for future API auth | Keeps options open for token-based access without over-engineering now. |

---

## 3. Feature Map

| Area | Highlights | Key Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users & Roles | Soft-deletable users with dependency-aware deletion, role assignments, login tracking. | `app/Models/User.php`, `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Tables/UsersTable.php` |
| Agencies | Rich profile fields, media attachments, vendor relationships, rating metrics. | `app/Models/Agency.php`, `app/Filament/Resources/Agencies/*` |
| Vendors | Category + pricing info, services, availability calendar, agency partnerships. | `app/Models/Vendor.php`, `app/Filament/Resources/Vendors/*` |
| Clients & Inquiries | Inquiry lifecycle (new → responded → booked), urgency flags, follow-up tracking, messaging. | `app/Models/Client.php`, `app/Models/Inquiry.php`, `app/Filament/Resources/Inquiries/*` |
| Matching & Bookings | Morph relationships for packages, bookings, reviews, FAQs that attach to agencies or vendors. | `app/Models/Booking.php`, `app/Models/Package.php`, etc. |
| Media | `media` migration + collections for logo/banner/gallery/documents enforce consistent storage. | `database/migrations/2025_11_23_000001_create_media_table.php` |
| Public API | Read-only endpoints for agencies/vendors with filtering, sorting, pagination, media URLs. | `routes/api.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/*`, `app/Http/Resources/*` |

---

## 4. Domain Logic Highlights

### 4.1 Users & Roles
- Users cover admins, agencies, vendors, and clients; role logic flows through Filament resources and policies.
- Soft deletes are enforced everywhere, with guardrails in `UsersTable` that hide delete buttons when dependencies exist and deliver persistent warnings before force deletes.
- Spatie Media Library allows avatars/documents to attach just like vendor logos.

### 4.2 Agencies
- Attributes (business name, slug, location, contact, specialties, years in business) live in `app/Models/Agency`.
- Relationships: vendors (approved/pending/rejected), inquiries, portfolio images, packages, reviews, FAQs, bookings, tags.
- Helpers such as `incrementViewsCount()` and `updateRatingStats()` keep dashboard metrics accurate.
- Filament resources provide search, Trashed filters, toggled columns, and scoped delete/restore/force actions.

### 4.3 Vendors
- Vendors include pricing ranges (`min_price`, `max_price`, `price_unit`), service areas, social links, arbitrary JSON `attributes`.
- Connected to categories, owning agencies, services, event types, tags, availability slots.
- Availability helper `isAvailableOn()` lets the frontend build calendars without duplicating logic.
- Media collections mirror agencies for consistent UX.

### 4.4 Clients & Inquiries
- Inquiries capture event metadata, budget, urgency, multiple note channels, and timestamps for response/follow-up/closure.
- Convenience methods (`markAsResponded`, `recordFollowUp`, `close`) prevent inconsistent status transitions.
- Messages, bookings, vendors, and agencies all relate back to each inquiry for auditing.

### 4.5 Matching, Services, Packages
- Services, packages, reviews, FAQs, and bookings rely on morph relationships so they can belong to either agencies or vendors.
- Tags offer cross-cutting categorization ("Luxury", "Destination", etc.).
- These abstractions keep the schema DRY yet flexible for future asset types.

### 4.6 Media Handling
- `registerMediaCollections()` defines single-file vs. multi-file collections per model.
- API resources expose `logo`, `banner`, `gallery` URLs via Spatie helpers.
- The `media` table migration mirrors the official schema so conversions/responsive images can be enabled later without changes.

## 5. Admin & Partner Panels (Filament)

| Panel | Path | Purpose | Notable Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `/admin` | Full CRUD across users, agencies, vendors, clients, inquiries, bookings. | Filament Shield permissions, soft-delete filters, dependency-aware deletes, dashboard widgets. |
| Agency | `/agency` | Agency staff manage their vendors, respond to inquiries, maintain portfolios. | Custom `AgencyPanelProvider` scopes resources and branding. |
| Vendor | `/vendor` | Vendors update profiles, services, availability, respond to leads. | Mirrors agency panel with vendor-specific navigation/resources. |

Why Filament?
- Rapid scaffolding with consistent UI components (tables, forms, infolists, dashboards).
- Built-in filters (search, column toggles, trashed) reduce bespoke UI work.
- Widgets put KPIs (e.g., inquiries per week) directly on panel dashboards.

Safety nets:
- Delete/force-delete actions only appear when the record lacks blocking dependencies (e.g., users tied to vendors/agencies).
- Confirmation copy explains consequences plainly and requires explicit admin confirmation.

### Response Shape & Rate Limiting
- Lists return Laravel pagination payloads (`data`, `links`, `meta`).
- Resources expose nested dictionaries (`location`, `contact`, `social`, `stats`, `media`) so the frontend can read structured data without extra transforms.
- When relationships are eager loaded (`tags`, `services`), the resources automatically append them.
- All API routes share `throttle:120,1`, limiting each IP to 120 requests/minute. Adjust in `routes/api.php` if traffic requires more headroom.

---

## 7. Data & Media Storage
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Sail. Run `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed` to bootstrap data.
- **Media:** Stored via Spatie Media Library under `storage/app/public`, exposed via `public/storage`. Collections include `logo`, `banner`, `gallery`, `portfolio`, `documents`.
- **Caching:** Not enabled yet, but architecture leaves room for query/response caching when the frontend traffic grows.

---

## 8. Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
./vendor/bin/sail composer install
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
```

Helpful commands:
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:filament-resource Vendor` – scaffold additional resources.
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed` – reset the DB while iterating quickly.
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link` – expose media assets.

---

## 11. Deployment & Environment Notes
- Configure DB (`DB_*`), queue (`QUEUE_CONNECTION`), mail (`MAIL_*`), storage (`FILESYSTEM_DISK=public`) in `.env` across environments.
- Always run `./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link` after provisioning so media URLs work.
- Queues: inquiries, notifications, and media conversions can move to queues—set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` by default.
- Monitoring: Laravel `/up` health route is enabled for uptime checks.

---

## 12. Roadmap / Next Steps
1. **Expand public API** – expose clients, inquiries (read-only), availability calendar endpoints, search suggestions.
2. **Authenticated API** – issue Sanctum tokens so agencies/vendors can use the same endpoints outside Filament.
3. **Caching & performance** – add response caching + ETags once marketing traffic scales.
4. **Analytics** – stream view counts/events to a warehouse or queue for deeper dashboards.
5. **Automations** – schedule follow-up reminders for inquiries that stay unanswered for N days.
